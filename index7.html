							<h3>Some facts</h3>
							<p>The Carpathians are one of the largest mountain systems in Europe. In Ukraine it is represented by the Eastern Carpathians and passes through the territory of Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zakarpattia and Chernivtsi regions - the total length is 280 km (from San to the sources of Suceava). This part is called the Ukrainian Carpathians, but this name is not geographical, but rather political and ideological. Be that as it may, this part of the mountain system may be of interest not only to lovers of skiing and snowboarding - there are many myths and legends about the Carpathians, and there are just enough interesting facts about them.

							<p>There are many rivers in the Carpathians, the largest of which are the Prut, Stryi, and Cheremosh. One of the most picturesque corners of the Carpathians - Synevyr Valley and its pearl - Lake Synevyr. Area - 7 hectares, depth - about 20 meters. Lake Synevir is surrounded on all sides by mountain slopes covered with slender spruces and spruces. In the middle of the lake is a small island that makes the lake look like an eye. Therefore, it is also called the sea eye.
